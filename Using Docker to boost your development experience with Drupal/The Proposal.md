# The Proposal

## Session title
Using Docker to boost your development experience with Drupal

## Session description
The goal of this presentation is to introduce Docker to ordinary Drupal 
developer who is currently using standard LAMP setup on their development 
environment and would like to improve their overall development experience with 
Drupal, so they can concentrate more on the code and less on configuring their 
development environments.

The talk will also include a brief introduction to Docker itself and how would 
you introduce it to your team based on our own personal experience, so everyone 
in your team could leverage the potential that Docker provides to solve your 
particular problems.

At the end of the presentation we have planned a small demo that would show the 
audience how easy it is to use Docker as a platform to develop Drupal based 
projects on it and how little you really need to know to get started with it.

## Audience
The presentation is mostly aimed towards Drupal developers who feel that too 
much of their development effort is waisted on configuring development 
environments and they rather would work with Drupal which often matters most to 
them and for the company they are working for and are ready to take some easy 
steps to fix it.
