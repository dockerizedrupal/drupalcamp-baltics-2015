# The Proposal

## Session title
Using Docker to boost your development experience with Drupal

## Session description
The goal of this presentation is to introduce Docker to ordinary Drupal 
developer who is currently using standard LAMP setup on their development 
environment and would like to improve their overall development experience with 
Drupal, so they can concentrate more on the code and less on configuring their 
development environments.

The talk will also include a brief introduction to Docker itself and how would 
you introduce it to your team based on our personal experience, so everyone in 
your team could leverage the potential that Docker has to solve your particular 
problem.

At the end of the presentation we have planned a small demo that would show the 
audience how easy it is to use Docker as a platform to develop Drupal based 
projects on it and how little you really need to know to get started with it.

## Audience
The presentation is mostly aimed to every Drupal developer that feel that more 
than it should of their valuable potential is going towards configuring their 
development environments and are ready take some easy steps to fix it.
