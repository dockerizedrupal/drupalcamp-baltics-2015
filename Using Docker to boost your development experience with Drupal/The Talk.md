# The Talk

Hi guys!

Before we start with the actual presentation let us first introduce ourselves.

My name is Jürgen, I am a full time Drupal developer in Fenomen web agency. I 
have about 4 years of experience with Drupal professionally.

My Name is Mait and I work for Fenomen web agency as well. I have been working 
with Drupal for about 1 year professionally.

So that now everyone knows briefly who we are, lets talk about Drupal and 
Docker. How can these two technologies work together and why you should care.

The fact that I now have almost 4000 commits in GitHub shows that I have discovered something awesome that is worth the time to invest in.

Docker skyrocketed my productivity immensely. It molded my thinking in a way that

From that day on I never



## Backlog

Why have we decided to use Docker in our work environment?

Support for different platform

What problems Docker solves and what problems Docker introduces

A developer 90% of the time doesn’t event relize that he/she is working woth Docker while developing in Drupal.

The famous matrix of hell.
